# Synthetics Examples

This repository contains examples of Elastic Synthetics configurations, and instructions for running them both locally, via CI, and via Heartbeat.

See the `todos` and `e-commerce` directories, and their respective `README` to find out more about each example.

We run the tests suites contained in each on all PRs and merges. See the `.github/workflows` directory to see sample CI configurations.

For deploying via Heartbeat see the `heartbeat` folder.
